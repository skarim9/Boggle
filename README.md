# Boggle

Boggle is a simple word game that involves forming as many words as you can from a grid of letters. It's like sort of like a word search. This Boggle, however, has several special rules that make scoring and forming words more difficult and challenging. These rules include a minimum word length of 4, minimum number of vowels of 2, and no reuse of letters.
